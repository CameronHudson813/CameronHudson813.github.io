Here we drop columns that are likely unhelpful in making a prediction on the species of penguins, specifying axis = 1 to delete the column instead of the index. We then remove all rows were the value of df[“Sex”] is undefined or “.”. We use the method dropna() to drop all the rows that contain missing values. We then use the method fit() from the LabelEncoder object to pick numerical values from qualitative values. For example, our penguin species are “Gentoo”, “Chinstrap”, and “Adelie” which could be encoded as 0, 1, and 2. Now that we have encoded the values of the “Species” column, we create a column that uses that encoding with le.transform, and we want to use the encoded values on the “Species” column, so we will do le.transform(df[“Species”]) and store this new column in y. We will then drop the original Species column as we will not need it for our prediction. Finally, we do pd.get_dummies(df) which will convert all categorical variables that only have 2 unique values to a 0 or a 1. With this, we have prepared are data and are ready to use it to make predictions on species of Penguins.\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nle = LabelEncoder()\nle.fit(train[\"Species\"])\n\ndef prepare_data(df):\n  df = df.drop([\"studyName\", \"Sample Number\", \"Individual ID\", \"Date Egg\", \"Comments\", \"Region\"], axis = 1)\n  df = df[df[\"Sex\"] != \".\"]\n  df = df.dropna()\n  y = le.transform(df[\"Species\"])\n  df = df.drop([\"Species\"], axis = 1)\n  df = pd.get_dummies(df)\n  return df, y\n\nfor i, c in enumerate(le.classes_):\n    print(f\"Class number {i} represents {c} penguins.\")\n\nX_train, y_train = prepare_data(train)\n\nClass number 0 represents Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) penguins.\nClass number 1 represents Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) penguins.\nClass number 2 represents Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) penguins.\nX_train.shape[0], y_train.shape[0]\n\n(256, 256)\nHere, we also enumerated through the classes made by the LabelEncoder and used a fstring to cleanly show which number encoding referes to which penguin.\nNow we can see that we have removed unnessecary columns,\nX_train.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nBody Mass (g)\nDelta 15 N (o/oo)\nDelta 13 C (o/oo)\nIsland_Biscoe\nIsland_Dream\nIsland_Torgersen\nStage_Adult, 1 Egg Stage\nClutch Completion_No\nClutch Completion_Yes\nSex_FEMALE\nSex_MALE\n\n\n\n\n0\n40.9\n16.6\n187.0\n3200.0\n9.08458\n-24.54903\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n1\n49.0\n19.5\n210.0\n3950.0\n9.53262\n-24.66867\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\n50.0\n15.2\n218.0\n5700.0\n8.25540\n-25.40075\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\n45.8\n14.6\n210.0\n4200.0\n7.79958\n-25.62618\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n4\n51.0\n18.8\n203.0\n4100.0\n9.23196\n-24.17282\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nHere we use the train_test_split method to split our training and testing data.
